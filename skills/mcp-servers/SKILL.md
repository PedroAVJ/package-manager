# MCP Servers

Use the installed `add-mcp` CLI for MCP discovery, local configuration audits,
explicit temporary evaluation, and orphan cleanup. It can write each agent's
native config file, so one command can cover multiple clients instead of
hand-editing `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.claude.json`, and the rest.

For anything the user authors or adopts permanently, the final delivery state is
an MCP definition, adapter, and supporting instructions inside the owning
versioned plugin. `add-mcp add` is not a substitute for packaging, testing,
and releasing that plugin. Provider-managed system integrations remain in
their provider-owned layer.

This is the MCP counterpart to the `skills` CLI: `skills` installs SKILL.md
directories, `add-mcp` installs MCP servers. Neither one installs plugins —
Claude Code and Codex plugin marketplaces are separate and per-agent.

## Start

Verify the command before relying on it:

```bash
command -v add-mcp && add-mcp --version
```

If missing: `npm install -g add-mcp`.

Every subcommand defaults to **project scope** (writes config into the
current directory). Pass `-g` for user-level config. Get the scope right
before running anything — a project-scope install in the wrong directory
leaves stray config files behind.

## Two Ways to Attach an MCP Server

The same MCP server can be attached in two different ways, and only one of
them is `add-mcp`'s business. The difference is **who acts as the MCP
client**, not what the server is.

**Locally configured** — the agent on this machine is the client. The
definition is a URL or command in the agent's own config, and any OAuth
token lands locally. Portable: the same recipe works in every agent. This is
what `add-mcp` manages. In Codex these are `[mcp_servers.*]` in
`~/.codex/config.toml`; in Claude Code, `claude mcp add` scopes.

**Vendor-brokered** — the vendor's cloud is the client. You register the
server in your *account*, the vendor's infrastructure connects out to it and
holds the OAuth grant, and nothing lands on disk. Not portable, by design.
Anthropic calls these **connectors** (from the Connectors Directory, or
**custom connectors** when you supply the URL yourself). OpenAI calls the
equivalent **apps** — `[apps.*]` in `config.toml`, an opaque ID and an
enabled flag, no URL or credential.

The trap: "custom connector" describes *who chose the server*, not *who
brokers it*. Pasting `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` into Claude's connector
settings and running `add-mcp https://mcp.linear.app/mcp -a claude-code`
point at the identical server, but the first is vendor-brokered and the
second is local. Registering one does not create the other.

OAuth is not the dividing line. A locally configured server can hold its own
OAuth grant — `codex mcp login` exists for exactly that. What makes an
integration brokered is that the *vendor's* infrastructure runs the client,
not that authentication is involved.

Practical consequence when auditing: a vendor-brokered integration will
never appear in `add-mcp list`, and that is correct rather than broken.
Never read an empty `list` as "this agent has no MCP tools" — it means "no
locally configured servers." Check the agent's actual tool list too.

## Find a Server

Search the integrations.sh registry. Omit the keyword to browse.

```bash
add-mcp find sentry
```

`find` installs the selected entry, so it takes the same scope and agent
flags as `add`.

## Install a Server

Remote servers take a URL; local stdio servers take a package name.

```bash
# Remote HTTP server, all agents, user-level
add-mcp https://mcp.example.com/mcp -g --all -y

# Remote server with auth header, Claude Code and Codex only
add-mcp https://mcp.example.com/mcp -g -a claude-code -a codex \
  -h 'Authorization: Bearer ${EXAMPLE_TOKEN}'

# Local stdio server with env and args
add-mcp some-mcp-package -g -n example \
  --env 'API_KEY=${EXAMPLE_API_KEY}' --args --read-only
```

Flags that matter:

- `-a <agent>` — repeatable; target specific agents. `--all` installs everywhere.
- `-n <name>` — server name; inferred from the target when omitted. Set it
  explicitly when the inferred name would be ugly or collide.
- `-t http|sse` — transport for remote servers.
- `-h 'Key: Value'` / `--env 'KEY=VALUE'` / `--args <arg>` — repeatable.
- `--auto-approve` — auto-approve tool calls. Only Codex and Claude Code
  support it; other agents get a warning and the flag is dropped. Scope it
  with `--approve-tool <tool>` rather than blanket-approving a server whose
  tools write or send.
- `--gitignore` — for project-scope installs, keeps generated config out of git.

Always single-quote `${VAR}` placeholders so the shell does not expand them.
The CLI prompts for the value interactively unless `-y` is set, and stores a
placeholder reference rather than the literal secret.

## Audit What Is Installed

```bash
add-mcp list -g
```

Prints every detected agent and its configured servers. Run this before
adding anything — the same server is often already installed under a
different name in another agent.

`list` only sees locally configured servers — see "Two Ways to Attach an MCP
Server" above before concluding an agent is empty.

## Reuse a Claude Desktop Extension (.mcpb)

`.mcpb` bundles — MCP Bundles, formerly Desktop Extensions (`.dxt`) — are
Claude Desktop's one-click format for local servers. No other agent hosts
them: Claude Code is not an `.mcpb` host, Codex has no notion of the format
(`codex mcp` takes servers only), and `add-mcp` cannot read one.

The payload is still an ordinary stdio MCP server, so the recipe transfers
even though the packaging does not. Extract it with the official CLI:

```bash
npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcpb info <bundle>.mcpb          # inspect in place
npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcpb unpack <bundle>.mcpb ./out  # extract
```

A bundle is a zip, so `unzip` works too. Read `manifest.json` →
`server.mcp_config`, which holds `command`, `args`, and `env` (with optional
`platform_overrides` per OS).

Resolve the manifest placeholders by hand. The host app normally does this
and no other agent will:

- `${__dirname}` → absolute path of the unpacked directory
- `${HOME}`, `${DESKTOP}`, `${DOCUMENTS}`, `${DOWNLOADS}`
- `${pathSeparator}` or `${/}`
- `${user_config.KEY}` → the value the manifest's `user_config` block requests

Then register the resolved command like any other stdio server:

```bash
add-mcp <command> -g -n <name> --args <arg> --args <arg> --env 'KEY=VALUE'
```

Confirm the interpreter resolves outside Claude Desktop before reporting
success — bundles frequently assume the desktop app's bundled Node or Python
runtime rather than one on `PATH`.

## Remove a Server

```bash
add-mcp remove <query> -g
```

Matches by name and prompts per match. `-a <agent>` narrows to specific
agents; `-y` removes all matches without prompting — only use it when
`list` has already shown exactly what will be hit.

## Sync Across Agents

```bash
add-mcp sync -g
```

Reconciles server names and installations across all detected agents. This
is the cleanup command: it is how a server that exists only in Codex gets
mirrored into Claude Code, and how divergent names for the same server get
unified. It rewrites multiple agents' configs at once, so run `list` first
and review the plan it prints rather than passing `-y` blind.

## Supported Agents

`add-mcp list-agents` prints the current table. As of v2.0.0: antigravity,
cline, cline-cli, claude-code, claude-desktop, codex, cursor, gemini-cli,
goose, github-copilot-cli, grok-build, mcporter, opencode, vscode, windsurf,
zed.

Project scope is not universal — Claude Desktop, Goose, Windsurf, Cline, and
Antigravity are global-only. Check the `Local`/`Global` columns before
assuming a project-scope install will land.

## After Installing

Agents read MCP config at startup. Restart the target agent before reporting
that a server is available, and confirm the tools actually appear rather
than inferring success from a clean exit code.
